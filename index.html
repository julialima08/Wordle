    <h4>How to play:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Simply click on the keys on the provided keyboard to write your first word.</li>
      <li>If one of the letters in your word is correct and in the correct place, the tile will turn green.</li>
      <li>If one of the letters in your word is correct but not in its correct place, the tile will turn yellow.</li>
      <li>You will have 6 chances to guess the randomized word. If you guess the word, you will move on to the next level. If you don't guess the word in 6 tries, you will have to start over with a new word.</li>
