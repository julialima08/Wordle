### **_Description_**

#### This is my own version of the popular game Wordle made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. This game generates a random five letter word that the player must guess within six attempts. One thing that is different from the original wordle game is that my game has three levels. With each level, the word length grows progresively longer. I also added a dark theme so that players can costumize the styling of their game.

### **_How to play_**

##### Simply click on the keys on the provided keyboard to write your first word.

##### If one of the letters in your word is correct and in the correct place, the tile will turn green.

##### If one of the letters in your word is correct but not in its correct place, the tile will turn yellow.

##### In dark mode, the green tiles become purple and the yellow tiles become dark blue.

##### You will have 6 chances to guess the randomized word. If you guess the word, you will move on to the next level. If you don't guess the word in 6 tries, you will have to start over with a new word.
