### **_How to play_**

##### Simply click on the keys on the provided keyboard to write your first word.

##### If one of the letters in your word is correct and in the correct place, the tile will turn green.

##### If one of the letters in your word is correct but not in its correct place, the tile will turn yellow.

##### You will have 6 chances to guess the randomized word. If you guess the word, you will move on to the next level. If you don't guess the word in 6 tries, you will have to start over with a new word.
